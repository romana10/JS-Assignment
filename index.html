   <h3>1. Explain the difference between 'if...else' and 'switch' statements for conditional logic.</h3>
   <p>Answer :

    'If...else' statements are generally used when we have multiple conditions to work with. We can use "if" conditions one by one followed by an else block where we can perform different actions and execute different outputs. Its flexible and can perform with logical operators. 
    On the contrary, 'switch' statements are used when we want to compare single value against multiple cases. It only evaluates character or integer datatype and checks only for equality. Its faster because instead of checking which case is satisfied (as it is in if conditions) it only decides which case to be executed.

    <h3>3. Explain the difference between var, let, and const when declaring variables in JavaScript.</h3>
    <p> Answer : 
        
    While declaring variables in JS we use var, let and const but they have different behaviours. 
   
    1. 'Var' declaration is function scoped while 'let' and 'const' declaration are block scoped.
    2. Variables that are declared by 'var' can be re-declared and updated. Variables declared by 'let' can be updated but cannot be re-declared. Variables declared by 'const' can not be re-declared or updated.
    3. 'Var' and 'let'can be declared without  initialization. But 'const' cannot be declared without initialization.

    <h3>5. What is the difference between "null" and "undefined" in JavaScript?</h3>
    <p>Answer :

        In JS, 'null' means an empty value or a blank value and it is actually a primitive type in Javascript. On the contrary, 'undefined' means that the variable has been declared but its value has not been assigned. so, if we assign 'null' to a variable it becomes an assignment value, but if there is no value assigned to the variable, it becomes undefined.
